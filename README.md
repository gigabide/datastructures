<h1> Data Structures </h1>

This is a short little repo containing my own implementations of certain data structures and their various methods. Many of these implementations take after examples provided by my professors as well as the beloved *Introduction To Algorithms: Third Edition*. These are not without errors, and I tried to document them as best as I could at the time. This repo is set to contain the following data structures:

<ul> 
    <li>Array List</li>
    <li>Linked List</li>
    <li>Doubly Linked List</li>
    <li>Adjacency List</li>
    <li>Adjacency Matrix</li>
    <li>Binary Tree</li>
    <li>Binary Heap</li>
    <li>Binomial Heap</li>
    <li>R Way Trie</li>
    <li>Circular Array</li>
    <li>Circular Linked List</li>
</ul>
